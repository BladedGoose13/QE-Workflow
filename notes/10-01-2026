# 2026-01-10 — QE research log

## What I did
- Data analysis and post-processing using `pp.x`:

```text
&INPUTPP
prefix = 'gr'
outdir = '../tmp/'
plot_num = 0
/
&PLOT
iflag = 3
output_format = 5
fileout = 'graphene.xsf'
/

- pp.x < pp.in > pp.out (data cleaning to .xsf format)

- VESTA visualization:

- VESTA confirms:
  - Hexagonal lattice (a=b=2.462 Å, γ=120°)
  - Two-atom primitive cell
  - Vacuum along c = 10 Å

### Data archive
- Visualization data stored in `10-01-2026.xsf`

## What I learned
- DFT theory (Γ–K–M, Kohn–Sham, Pseudopotentials)
- Conceptual distinction between SCF and NSCF calculations in plane-wave DFT
- Linux nano command
- QE-based data configuration and handling (tmp, .save, outdir, prefix)

- The SCF charge density visualization confirms the expected sp² covalent bonding in graphene, with electron density localized between nearest carbon atoms and a planar hexagonal lattice.

> SCF defines physics.  
> NSCF explores it.  
> ecutwfc describes how well approximated it is.

## Problems
- N/A

## Next
- Perform NSCF calculation for graphene
- Converge k-point sampling and ecutwfc
- Compute band structure and DOS along Γ–K–M
