# 2026-01-07 — QE learning log

## What I did
- Installed VESTA
- Ran first SCF for sample data
    - mpirun -np 4 pw.x < scf.in > scf.out
    - ibrav = 4 ; nat = 2 ; k-points = 12×12×1 (19 irreducible)
- SCF converged in 25 iterations 
- Fermi energy = -0.4057 eV (reference-dependent)
- Configured shared file linux-windows for proper data transfer and analysis

## What I learned
- Iterative property of QE's algorithm and general methodology
- QE data output format and basic interpretation
- SCF stability and convergence depend strongly on k-point sampling quality

## Problems
- XCrySDen fails in VM (OpenGL issue)

## Next
- Export .xsf and visualize in VESTA
- Test ecutwfc convergence
- Develop independent criteria for dataset reliability beyond academic references
